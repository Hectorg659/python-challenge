## Summary
This challenge included two challenges in one. The first portion was creating a Python script to analyze financial records of a company throughout a certain amount of time. The primary goal of this analyzation was to figure out the net total amount of profit/loses, find the change in profit/losses, and also finding the greatest increase/decrease of the entire data set. The second challenge was to analyze election data from a certain period. For this challenge the primary goal was to figure out the complete list of those who received votes, the percentage of votes each won, the total number of votes each won, and finally the overall winner of the election.
